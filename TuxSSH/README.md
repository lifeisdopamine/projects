TuxSSH is an all-in-one terminal based ssh client, written in C and bash.
The source code is available in the src folder, but the src folder does not 
include the dependencies required to run the program, the tar archive has all
the files required to run.

TO INSTALL:
1. Download the TuxSSH.tar.gz tar archive and install.sh script
2. Open a terminal and run ./install.sh
3. You're done! Run ./ssh to run the program.

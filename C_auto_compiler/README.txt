This program utilises bash system commands to auto
compile your C programs for you. It supports single
file compiles and triple (logic, main, and header) 
file compiles, and a link math option as well.
The program will compile each program with all 
flags and warnings attached (-g and -Wall), so 
it itself also acts as a bit of a debugger as well
(if your program has issues). The program will also 
automatically run your program if it can.

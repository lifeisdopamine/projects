Work in progress.

Compiled with apue.3e library, so get the apue.3e source files and change the path names in the Makefile to recompile.

Reads in .bmp file formats and displays simple information such as file size, header sizes, color tables, etc and also
more complex information such as color values for each pixel. Writing to files is currently still being implemented.
